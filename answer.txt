a.In private inheritance, all members in base class become private in derived class; In a public inheritance, the subclass will inherit the pubic and protected data from the base (super) class and store it in the public space.

b.If a call to the base class constructor wasn't call, then the compiler will call the default constructor of the base class.

c.Two example of member functions that are not inherited by the derived class are setAcademicDegree() and setClassification().

d.It is possible for a derived class to inherit more than one base class. Instead of the single inheritance like this - class Snake : public Animal, you can do multiple inheritance like this -class Snake : public Animal, public Drawing.

e.Usually overloading an operator are place inside the class, but for i/o base operator overloading it is better to place it outside the class.
